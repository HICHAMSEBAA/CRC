# Cyclic redundancy check  'CRC'
 is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to digital data.

 # About This Repository
 I wrote this script python for calculate crc code 

 # Modules used 
in this script i don't need to use any module

# How to use this script ?
### firstly
Enter your binary sequence ! must be space between bit and anther

## secondly
Enter you CRC polynomial ! must be space between bit and anther

# Exmple :

```
Enter Your Message : 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
Enter Your CRC Polynomial : 1 0 1 1

```
